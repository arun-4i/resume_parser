# Swagger Documentation Feedback

## What errors or blockers were encountered?

- Initial confusion about when to tick off tasks in the implementation checklist; clarified that each step should be checked off immediately after completion.
- PowerShell command syntax issues when creating feedback directories/files; resolved by switching to correct PowerShell commands.
- Minor ESLint, TypeScript, and SonarQube compliance issues during Swagger/OpenAPI integration, all addressed with concise fixes.

## Was the feature request clear? If not, what was missing?

- The overall feature request was clear, but the workflow for ticking off tasks and feedback log requirements needed explicit clarification.

## How could the plan/checklist be improved for next time?

- Make the requirement to tick off each checklist item immediately after completion more explicit in the plan and rules.
- Clearly document the feedback log workflow and file naming convention in the rules from the start.

## What should the AI do differently in future planning?

- Proactively tick off completed tasks in the plan without waiting for user prompts.
- Ask for clarification immediately if any workflow or rule is ambiguous.
- Ensure all optional and required rules are clearly distinguished in the rules file.

## Any other notes for improvement?

- The structured feedback log and checklist approach improved traceability and auditability.
- The new rules and templates make onboarding and compliance easier for future contributors.
