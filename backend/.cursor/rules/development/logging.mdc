# Logging and Audit Logging Standards

This file defines logging and audit logging standards for backend development. For related development standards, see other files in the development folder.

## Winston Logger

- Use Winston for all application logging
- Configure log levels for dev/prod
- Use structured JSON logs
- Example:

```ts
import winston from "winston";
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: "info",
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [new winston.transports.Console()],
});
logger.info("User created", { userId });
```

## Audit Logging

- Log all CRUD operations to a separate audit log/table
- Include user context and timestamps
- Retain audit logs for at least 1 year
- Example:

```ts
auditLogger.log("user.update", { userId, changes, performedBy });
```

## Log Contexts

- Use context strings (e.g., 'api', 'audit') for all logs
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, secrets)

## Compliance

- Follow industry standards for log retention and security
- Reference [rules/development/error-handling.mdc] for error logging
