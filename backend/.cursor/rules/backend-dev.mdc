# Backend Development Overview

This file provides a high-level overview of backend development for this project. For detailed standards, see the modular rule files referenced in .cursorrules.

## Purpose

- Guide ongoing backend development and refactoring
- Reference for best practices and architecture
- All technical details and standards are now in modular rule files

## Key Principles

- Security, performance, and maintainability are top priorities
- Follow clean architecture: separation of concerns between controllers, services, repositories
- Use TypeScript, Express, and Sequelize as core stack
- All new features and refactors must start with a detailed, tickable plan (see [rules/workflow.mdc])
- Retrospective & feedback required after implementation (see [rules/workflow.mdc])

## Modular Rules
