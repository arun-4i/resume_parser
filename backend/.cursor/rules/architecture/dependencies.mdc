# Import Patterns, TypeScript Config, and Dependency Management

This file defines import patterns, TypeScript configuration, and dependency management standards for backend development. For related standards, see other modular rule files referenced in .cursorrules.

## Import Patterns

- Use TypeScript path aliases as defined in tsconfig.json (e.g., @/services, @/models; @ = src/)
- Avoid relative imports (e.g., ../../services/userService) in favor of path aliases
- Example:

```ts
import { UserService } from "@/services/userService";
```

## TypeScript Configuration

- Use strict mode (`strict: true` in tsconfig.json)
- Target ES2020 or newer
- Enable all strict family options (strictNullChecks, strictFunctionTypes, etc.)
- Keep tsconfig.json up to date with project structure

## Dependency Management

- Use npm or yarn for package management
- Keep dependencies minimal and up to date
- Regularly audit dependencies for security
- Use specific versions for core dependencies (Express, Sequelize, etc.)
- Reference [rules/deployment/environment.mdc] for environment config
