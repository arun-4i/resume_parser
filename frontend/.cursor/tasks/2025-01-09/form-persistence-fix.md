# Form Persistence Fix Plan

## Issue

User reported that form state was being reset after submission, requiring them to re-enter all data if they wanted to modify and resubmit.

## Root Cause

React Hook Form automatically resets the form to default values after successful submission by default.

## Solution Implemented

Modified the `handleSubmit` function in `ResumeCompareForm.tsx` to preserve form values after successful submission:

```typescript
// In handleSubmit function, after successful submission:
form.reset(data); // Reset form to current values to prevent clearing
```

This approach:

- Maintains React Hook Form's validation and submission flow
- Prevents the form from being cleared after successful submission
- Allows users to modify fields and resubmit without re-entering data
- Preserves the current values by "resetting" the form to its current state

## Files Modified

- `src/components/shared/resume-compare/ResumeCompareForm.tsx`
  - Added `form.reset(data)` after successful submission to preserve form values

## Testing

- Build compilation successful ✅
- Form now preserves data after submission ✅
- Users can modify and resubmit without losing their input ✅

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

Form persistence issue resolved. Users can now modify and resubmit forms without losing their data.
