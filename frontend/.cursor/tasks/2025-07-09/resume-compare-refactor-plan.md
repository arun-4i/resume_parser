# Feature Plan: Resume Compare Refactor (ChatGPT-like UI, Server Actions, Component Split)

## Requirements Clarification

- **Feature Overview:**

  - Refactor the resume compare page to use a server component, with all client logic/UI in client components.
  - Use a Next.js server action for the API call to `/resume/summary` (base URL handled by axiosInstance).
  - UI should emulate ChatGPT: input textbox (form) is centered initially, then animates to the left after submit, with the response/chat area expanding to fill the main screen and rendering the LLM response line by line with animation.
  - All code must be split into server/client components, use a Next.js server action for the API call, and follow all project and .cursorrules standards.
  - Use framer-motion for all animated transitions.
  - No test scaffolding required for now.

- **Component/API Specification:**

  - `ResumeComparePage` (server component): Handles layout, imports and renders the main client component, this resides inside the page.tsx of the resume-compare folder.
  - `ResumeCompareClient` (client component): Handles form, state, and UI logic.
  - Further split into smaller components as needed (e.g., `ResumeCompareForm`, `ResumeCompareChat`, `ResumeCompareAvatar`, `ResumeCompareLayout`, etc.) for clarity and performance, this will be inside the `src\components\shared\resume-compare` folder.
  - Server action: `resumeCompareServerAction` in `src/app/actions/resume-compare/resume-compare-server-action.ts` handles the API call and returns the result.

- **Validation Requirements:**

  - Only accept PDF/DOCX for resume upload.
  - Job description must not be empty.
  - Handle file size limits and invalid input gracefully.
  - use zod validation and show the error using <FormMessage>,HTML error should not be shown

- **Business Logic Rules:**

  - Use server actions for all API calls.
  - Use strict TypeScript types.
  - Use shadcn and Tailwind for all UI.
  - Follow feature-first, scalable folder structure, with simple easy to understand code with proper seperation of concerns.

- **Error Handling:**

  - Show user-friendly errors for invalid file, parse failures, LLM/API errors, and network issues, any form validation errors.

- **Security & Authorization:**

  - Sanitize all inputs.
  - No sensitive data logging.
  - Use secure file handling.

- **Logging & Auditing:**

  - Log errors server-side only. No PII in logs.

- **Performance/Scalability:**

  - Minimize client bundle size.
  - Use memoization and code splitting for client components.
  - UI must not block on upload/parse/LLM.

- **Additional Context:**
  - All code must follow .cursorrules, frontend-dev.mdc, and code-review.mdc.
  - Use Next.js 15+ and React 19+ features.
  - All client components must have "use client" at the top.

## Plan Checklist

- [x] Generate this plan and get user approval.
- [x] Scaffold the following structure:
  - src/app/resume-compare/page.tsx (server component)
  - src/app/actions/resume-compare/resume-compare-server-action.ts (server action)
  - src/components/shared/resume-compare/ResumeCompareClient.tsx (main client component)
  - src/components/shared/resume-compare/ResumeCompareForm.tsx (form/input component)
  - src/components/shared/resume-compare/ResumeCompareChat.tsx (chat/response component)
  - src/components/shared/resume-compare/ResumeCompareAvatar.tsx (avatar component)
  - src/components/shared/resume-compare/ResumeCompareLayout.tsx (layout/animation wrapper)
  - (other small components as needed for animation, transitions, etc.)
- [x] Implement the server action to handle FormData upload and call `/resume/summary`, returning `{ content }`.
- [x] Implement layout/animation wrapper to handle the transition of the form from center to left and chat area expansion.
- [x] Implement the form as a client component, centered initially, animating to the left after submit, handling file upload and job description input, and triggering the server action.
- [x] Implement the chat/response component, taking over the main screen after submit, rendering the LLM response line by line with animation.
- [x] Implement the avatar component using shadcn Avatar with SVG assistant face.
- [x] Wire up all components, manage state and transitions, and call the server action. Optimize for accessibility, responsiveness, and performance.
- [x] Replace the page file with a server component that renders the client component.
- [x] Review and test the full flow for smooth transitions, accessibility, and responsiveness. Refine UI/UX for a ChatGPT-like experience.

## Feedback Section (to be filled after implementation)

- **What errors or blockers were encountered?**

  - TypeScript errors with Zod schema `.transform()` and React Hook Form compatibility. Fixed by removing transform and handling file extraction in submit handler.
  - ESLint warnings for unused parameters in components. Fixed with parameter renaming and eslint-disable comments.
  - Pre-existing shadcn Chart component type issue (unrelated to our changes) - does not affect resume compare functionality.

- **Was the feature request clear?**

  - Yes, the request was very clear with specific technical requirements and UI/UX expectations.

- **How could the plan/checklist or rules be improved?**

  - The plan was comprehensive and well-structured. Following the task list helped ensure no steps were missed.

- **Did any part of the rules or workflow cause confusion?**

  - No confusion. The .cursorrules and frontend-dev standards were clear and helpful.

- **What action(s) will be taken to address feedback?**

  - Implementation is complete and follows all specified requirements.

- **What should the AI do differently next time?**

  - Continue following the systematic approach: plan → scaffold → implement → test → review.

- **Any other notes?**
  - Successfully implemented ChatGPT-like UI with smooth animations, proper state management, comprehensive error handling, and full accessibility support.
  - All components follow React 19+ and Next.js 15+ best practices with proper TypeScript typing.
  - Used memoization for performance optimization and proper separation of concerns.
