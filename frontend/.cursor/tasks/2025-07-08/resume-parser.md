# Feature Plan: Resume Upload, Parsing, and LLM JD Comparison

# Description: Implements a Next.js UI and API for uploading a resume (PDF/DOCX), parsing it, inputting a Job Description, and sending both to an LLM for evaluation. Follows .cursorrules and referenced standards.

## Requirements Clarification

- **Feature Overview:**
  - Allow users to upload a resume (PDF/DOCX), parse it, input a Job Description, and receive an LLM-based evaluation comparing the two.
  - The website must support both LTR (English) and RTL (Arabic-like) layouts, with a language switcher dropdown in the navbar.
- **Component/API Specification:**
  - Frontend: File upload component, JD textarea, parsed resume display, LLM result display.
  - Navbar: Language switcher dropdown for English/Arabic (LTR/RTL toggle).
  - Backend: Next.js API route for file+JD upload, resume parsing (simple-resume-parser), prompt formatting, OpenAI LLM call, result return.
- **Validation Requirements:**
  - Only accept PDF/DOCX for resume upload. JD must not be empty. Handle file size limits.
  - Language switch must update UI direction and text.
- **Business Logic Rules:**
  - Use simple-resume-parser for extraction(https://github.com/kervin5/simple-resume-parser). Use provided prompt format for LLM. Return structured result. use Context7 MCP to access documentation.
  - All UI must correctly switch between LTR and RTL layouts and text.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Show user-friendly errors for invalid file, parse failures, LLM/API errors, and network issues.
- **Security & Authorization:**
  - Sanitize all inputs. No sensitive data logging. Use secure file handling. No auth required for MVP.
- **Logging & Auditing:**
  - Log errors server-side only. No PII in logs.
- **Performance/Scalability:**
  - Handle files up to 5MB. Async API. UI must not block on upload/parse/LLM.
  - Language switch must be instant and not reload the page.
- **Additional Context:**
  - Use OpenAI API key (to be provided) in env. Follow all .cursorrules and referenced standards.
