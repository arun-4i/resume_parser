# .cursor/.cursorrules — Frontend Rules Router & Workflow

# Main entry for all frontend rules, standards, and plans. Start here for any new feature, refactor, or process change.

# Always use the Context7 MCP tool to access documentation. Only provide the latest, up-to-date, non-deprecated code and APIs.

# The AI can and should use Context7 to access official documentation and get information about Next.js or any other technology as needed for planning, implementation, or clarification.

# WORKFLOW (Frontend)

1. **Requirements Clarification:** AI must always start by creating a requirements clarification section (using the template below) and get user confirmation or answers.
2. **Planning:** After clarification, AI must generate a detailed, tickable plan file in `.cursor/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD/` (today's date, in YYYY-MM-DD format) before any implementation begins. **This applies to all major changes, including process/rules changes.**
3. **Approval:** User must review and approve the plan file (add "Plan Approved By:" in the plan) before any code or implementation work starts. **The plan file is the single source of truth for the change until merged.**
4. **Implementation:** Only after approval, complete tasks, using the Bug-Prevention Checklist in each plan.
5. **Code Review & Testing:** All code must be reviewed and pass tests before completion. See code review and testing rules.
6. **Linting & Formatting:** All code must pass linting/formatting before merge. See linting rules.
7. **Retrospective & Feedback:** Fill out the feedback section in the plan after implementation.
8. **Continuous Improvement:** Review last feedback before new plans; update rules/processes as needed.

# ---

# FEEDBACK SECTION (add to each plan)

- What errors or blockers were encountered?
- Was the feature request clear?
- How could the plan/checklist or rules be improved?
- Did any part of the rules or workflow cause confusion?
- What action(s) will be taken to address feedback?
- What should the AI do differently next time?
- Any other notes?

# ---

# DOCUMENTATION & README GENERATION

- README or documentation changes should only be included in the plan and implementation if explicitly requested in requirements or referenced standards.

# ---

# COMPONENT PLACEMENT & RULES CHANGES (2025-07-01)

- All new custom components (e.g., Navbar) must be placed in 'src/components/'.
- The 'ui' directory is reserved only for shadcn components.
- Any rule/process change must:
  1. Be documented in a plan file in `.cursor/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD/`.
  2. Be reflected in the relevant rules file (e.g., frontend-dev.mdc).
  3. Be referenced in this file's workflow and rules index.

# ---

# CLIENT COMPONENT DIRECTIVE (2025-07-01)

- All React components that use client-side hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, useTheme) must include the 'use client' directive at the top of the file.
- This applies to all new and existing components.
- Any file that uses client-side hooks (such as useSidebar, useState, useEffect, useTheme, etc.) must include the 'use client' directive at the top. This applies to all new and existing components/layouts.

# ---

# RESPONSIVE & MOBILE-FIRST REQUIREMENTS (2025-01-09)

- All UIs must be fully responsive and tested on both mobile and desktop breakpoints.
- Use mobile-first design approach with Tailwind's responsive utilities (`lg:`, `md:`, etc.).
- Conditional rendering required for mobile vs desktop layouts when they differ significantly.
- Test all components on actual devices, not just browser dev tools.

# ---

# TYPESCRIPT & VALIDATION STANDARDS (2025-01-09)

- Use explicit TypeScript types for all function parameters, especially form data and validation schemas.
- Avoid relying solely on Zod inference for complex objects (e.g., FileList, nested objects).
- All user-facing forms must use Zod + React Hook Form for validation.
- Server actions must have comprehensive error handling and type safety.

# ---

# SONARQUBE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS (2025-01-09)

- Use `??` (nullish coalescing) instead of `||` for default values.
- Mark all props and function parameters as `readonly` where possible.
- Avoid deep nesting in JSX and logic (max 3 levels); prefer flat, readable structures.
- Do not use nested ternary operators; use if/else statements or helper functions instead.
- Avoid unused variables and parameters (prefix with `_` if needed).
- Extract complex logic into helper functions to improve readability.

# ---

# ACCESSIBILITY & ERROR HANDLING (2025-01-09)

- Accessibility is mandatory: use semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and ensure keyboard navigation.
- All error messages must be user-friendly and never expose internal details.
- Test all edge cases: empty, invalid, and large inputs.
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions (loading states, success/error messages).

# ---

# ANIMATION & PERFORMANCE (2025-01-09)

- Use Framer Motion for all UI transitions and animations.
- Animations must be fast (2-8ms per character for typing effects), smooth, and not block user input.
- Memoize components where appropriate to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback strategically for performance optimization.
