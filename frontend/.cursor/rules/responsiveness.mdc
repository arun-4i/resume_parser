# Responsiveness Rule

## 1. Mobile-First

- All layouts must be designed mobile-first.
- Use Tailwind's responsive utilities for breakpoints.

## 2. Breakpoints

- Use explicit breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl.
- Test on real devices (not just browser tools).

## 3. Layout Adaptation

- Ensure no horizontal scroll on any device.
- Form and chat must be usable on all breakpoints.

## 3. Layout Adaptation

- Ensure no horizontal scroll on any device.
