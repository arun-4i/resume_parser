# Animation Rule (Framer Motion)

## 1. Usage Policy

- Use Framer Motion only for complex, interactive animations that cannot be achieved with CSS.
- For simple transitions (opacity, scale, color), use Tailwind CSS transitions.

## 2. Performance

- Avoid Framer Motion if it adds >3KB to bundle for a single effect.
- Profile animation impact on mobile devices.

## 3. Review

- Remove unused animation code after feature changes.
