# Rendering Rule (SSR/ISR/CSR)

## 1. SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

- Use for pages with dynamic, user-specific, or frequently changing data.
- Example: Authenticated dashboards, personalized feeds.

## 2. ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

- Use for mostly-static content that updates periodically.
- Example: Marketing pages, blog posts.

## 3. CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

- Use for highly interactive, client-only features.
- Example: Chat UIs, dashboards with heavy JS.

## 4. Decision Workflow

- AI suggests best rendering per page based on data needs and UX, user will review and take decision accordingly.
- User has final call on rendering strategy.
- Document rendering choice in page/component docstring.
