# Hooks Usage Rule

## 1. Library Preference

- Prefer usehooks-ts for common hooks (intersection observer, etc.).

## 2. Custom Hooks

- Custom hooks must be documented with usage and return types.
- Place in `src/hooks/`.

## 3. Best Practices

- Avoid side effects in render phase.
- Memoize expensive computations.
- write a hook if the same functionality is used across compoenents, always prefer to modularize code.

## 3. Best Practices

- Avoid side effects in render phase.
- Memoize expensive computations.
