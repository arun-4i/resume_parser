# State Management Rule

## 1. URL State

- Use nuqs for state that must persist in the URL (e.g., filters, search).

## 2. Local State

- Use React useState for transient UI state.

## 3. Global State

- Use Zustand for application-wide state shared across components.
- Create focused stores for specific domains (auth, user preferences, etc.).
- Avoid global state for UI-only state that doesn't need persistence.

## 4. Memoization

- Memoize derived state and expensive selectors.

## 5. Hydration

- Ensure server/client state sync for SSR/ISR pages.
