# Validation Rule

## 1. Shared Zod Schema

- All validation must use a single Zod schema shared between client and server.
- No duplicate validation logic. Types must be inferred from Zod.

## 2. Base Schema Patterns

- Use base schemas for text, email, date, number, and file.
- Extend base schemas for feature-specific validation.

## 3. Input Sanitization

- All text inputs must be sanitized (see `.cursor/rules/security.mdc`).
- No emojis or special characters in text field unless explicitly allowed.

## 4. File Validation

- File uploads must be validated for type, size, and security.

## 5. Maintenance

- Update schemas on business logic change. Review quarterly.
